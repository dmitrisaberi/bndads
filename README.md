## Reproduce the results

To reproduce the results, `cd` into the project folder and run

```bash
python bandits/experiments/run_experiments.py
```

Once execution is complete, open and run [`plot_figures.ipynb`](https://github.com/probml/bandits/blob/main/bandits/experiments/plot_figures.ipynb) top to bottom to reproduce the plots.


An alternative way to reproduce the results is to simply open and run [`run_experiments.ipynb`](https://github.com/probml/bandits/blob/main/bandits/experiments/run_experiments.ipynb) top to bottom.
