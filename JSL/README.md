JSL is a JAX library for Bayesian inference in linear and non-linear Gaussian state-space models.
We assume that the model parameters are known, and just focus on state estimation.
For linear dynamical systems (LDS), we support Kalman filtering and RTS smoothing.
For nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS), we support extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with full and diagonal covariance,
unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) and bootstrap particle filtering (PF).

# Installation

```
pip install git+git://github.com/probml/jsl
```
Alternatively, you can clone the repo locally, into say `~/github/JSL`, and then install it as a package, as follows:
```
cd ~/github
git clone https://github.com/probml/JSL.git
cd JSL
pip install -e .
```

# Examples

To run the examples included in JSL from the command line, clone the repository and `cd` into `JSL`. Then run

```
python -m jsl run_demo [NAME_OF_DEMO]
```

To see the available demos, run

```
python -m jsl list_demos
```

Alternatively, you can run any demo directly from JSL after instalation by importing the desired demo and running its `main()` function as follows:

```python
>>> from jsl.demos import NAME_OF_DEMO
>> figures = NAME_OF_DEMO.main()
```

The resulting variable `figures` is a dictionary with values the output figures and keys the recommended figure names.
